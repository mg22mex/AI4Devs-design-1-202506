# Prompts for LTI-ATS Design

1. **System Overview**:
   - Describe a next-generation ATS for LTI, focusing on efficiency, collaboration, automation, and AI assistance. Highlight competitive advantages over existing solutions like Greenhouse or Lever.
2. **Functionalities**:
   - List the basic functionalities of an ATS, prioritized from highest to lowest, with brief descriptions.
3. **Benefits**:
   - Explain benefits for candidates and recruiters, referencing industry benchmarks where possible.
4. **Alternatives**:
   - Identify alternatives to an ATS and their relevance for different organization sizes or scenarios.
5. **Customer Journey**:
   - Outline the step-by-step customer journey for an ATS client, including interactions and actors involved.
6. **User Roles**:
   - Define user roles (e.g., recruiter, hiring manager), their actions, and dependencies within the ATS.
7. **Data Model**:
   - Create a data model with entities, attributes (name and type), relationships, and a Mermaid ER diagram.
8. **System Design**:
   - Design a high-level system architecture, including components, integration patterns, and a Mermaid diagram. Ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.
9. **C4 Diagram**:
   - Provide a C4 diagram (context, container, component) for the AI Engine component, with Mermaid code.
10. **Lean Canvas**:
    - Develop a Lean Canvas for LTI-ATS, including problem, solution, customer segments, and other elements, with a Mermaid diagram.
11. **Use Cases**:
    - Describe three main use cases (job posting, candidate screening, interview scheduling) with sequence diagrams in Mermaid.
12. **Visual Representations**:
    - Include Mermaid code for all diagrams (data model, system design, C4, Lean Canvas, use cases) with textual descriptions of what each visual representation depicts to ensure clarity. Integrate provided images for ER diagram, Lean Canvas, Job Posting and Distribution, Candidate Screening and Ranking, Interview Scheduling and Feedback, System Design Diagram, Context Diagram, and Container Diagram alongside the corresponding Mermaid code.
13. **AI Attribution**:
    - Explicitly mention that the document is generated by Grok, created by xAI, at the top of the design document, including the current date and time (04:55 PM CST, Monday, July 07, 2025).
